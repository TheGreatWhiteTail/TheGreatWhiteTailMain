          Hey offworlder! Welcome to The Great White Tail. Get ready for an adventure of a lifetime!
          Here’s a little history for you… A few hundred years ago (2760 AD), humans began developing 
         technologies at such a rate that the Earth’s resources were becoming exhausted. Finally, 
         after around 100 years, another planet was found. A “Goldilocks planet” they called it. Just
         enough of everything for our species to survive and go on. The planet was located in the 
         Andromidax system, 13,000 light years away. That’s when interstellar travel was born. Humans 
         began leaving Earth by the thousands. However, the fuel used for interstellar travel produced 
         a greenhouse gas with a potency never before seen. The polar ice caps melted, and sea levels 
         rose engulfing all but this small land mass you’ve come to visit. This volcano you see before 
         you, long thought to be extinct, has begun erupting. The sulphur dioxide it is releasing into 
         the atmosphere is causing a local cooling effect on the environment. Professor Hammerhead needs 
         your help to figure out what’s going on!
